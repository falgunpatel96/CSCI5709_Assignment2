I have deployed my website on Heroku using the heroku CLI by following the method provided on Github repository of [Mars Hall](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack)[1]. 

## Built With

#### Framework and Library Used
[ReactJS Library](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript Library to build interfaces  
[React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - Front-end Framework  
[react-router-dom](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - provides navigations between pages

#### Tools Used
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code Editor  
[GitHub](https://github.com/) - To Maintain Repository  
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - To deploy the website        

## Design Justification  
React Framework is used as front-end to develop this website because for the project of this subject our group decided to use React as the front-end framework. So, I choose to go with same. I have used Black and White color scheme for this website because it offers maximum contrast. This combination is a risk-free combination that ensures a design will look clean and catch the viewers' attention.       

## Acknowledgments

2. I have used the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) library documantation to get the basic syntax and customized it as needed[2].  
3. I have used some websites to know that what CSS parameters can be applied to get perticuler design.  
4. I have [Surveyanyplace](https://surveyanyplace.com/quiz-landing-page-examples/) to explore designs for landing page of Quiz App[3].
